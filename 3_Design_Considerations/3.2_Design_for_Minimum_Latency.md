QUIC is specifically designed to reduce protocol-induced delays, with features such as:

QUIC是专门被设计出来降低由协议引入的延迟的，并且具有以下特性：

1. Support for 0-RTT data during session resumption.

1. 在会话恢复期间支持0-RTT数据。

2. Support for advanced packet-loss recovery procedures as specified in "QUIC Loss Detection and Congestion Control" [RFC9002].

2. 支持高级的丢包恢复机制，《QUIC恢复》（详见《[RFC9002]()》）定义了这种机制。

3. Mitigation of head-of-line blocking by allowing parallel delivery of data on multiple streams.

3. 通过允许在复数流上并行发送数据的方式抵御队头阻塞。

This mapping of DNS to QUIC will take advantage of these features in three ways:

从DNS至QUIC的映射将在三个方面利用以上特性：

1. Optional support for sending 0-RTT data during session resumption (the security and privacy implications of this are discussed in later sections).

1. 在会话恢复期间对于0-RTT数据的可选支持（后续章节讨论了这一点对于安全性和隐私性的影响）。

2. Long-lived QUIC connections over which multiple DNS transactions are performed, generating the sustained traffic required to benefit from advanced recovery features.

2. 进行过多次DNS事务的稳定的QUIC连接所产生的持续流量使连接能够从高级的丢包恢复机制中受益。

3. Mapping of each DNS Query/Response transaction to a separate stream, to mitigate head-of-line blocking. This enables servers to respond to queries "out of order". It also enables clients to process responses as soon as they arrive, without having to wait for in-order delivery of responses previously posted by the server.

3. 为了抵御队头阻塞而将每项DNS查询/响应事务映射至一条独立流的做法使得服务器能够“乱序”响应查询。这还使得客户端能够随时处理刚刚到达的响应，而无需等待服务器发送的前序响应。

These considerations are reflected in the mapping of DNS traffic to QUIC streams in Section 4.2.

这些考量被反映在了[第4.2章]()内从DNS流量到QUIC流的映射中。
