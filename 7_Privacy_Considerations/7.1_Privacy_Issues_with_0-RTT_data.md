The 0-RTT data can be replayed by adversaries. That data may trigger queries by a recursive resolver to authoritative resolvers. Adversaries may be able to pick a time at which the recursive resolver outgoing traffic is observable and thus find out what name was queried for in the 0-RTT data.

0-RTT数据可能被攻击者重放。
此数据可能触发递归解析器向权威解析器的查询。
攻击者可能可能挑选一个方便观察递归解析器传出流量的时间，从而找出它为0-RTT数据查询的那个域名。

This risk is in fact a subset of the general problem of observing the behavior of the recursive resolver discussed in "DNS Privacy Considerations" [RFC9076]. The attack is partially mitigated by reducing the observability of this traffic. The mandatory replay protection mechanisms in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] limit but do not eliminate the risk of replay. 0-RTT packets can only be replayed within a narrow window, which is only wide enough to account for variations in clock skew and network transmission.

此风险的本质是在《关于DNS隐私的考量》（详见《[RFC9076]()》）中讨论的递归解析器行为观察问题的子集。
该攻击可以通过降低此流量的可观察性来部分抵御。
在TLS 1.3（详见《[RFC8446]()》）中强制性的重放保护机制能够限制重放的风险，但是无法完全消除。
只能在狭窄的时间窗口内重放0-RTT数据包，该窗口的宽度仅足够用来容许时钟偏差和网络传输的波动。

The recommendation for TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] is that the capability to use 0-RTT data should be turned off by default and only enabled if the user clearly understands the associated risks. In the case of DoQ, allowing 0-RTT data provides significant performance gains, and there is a concern that a recommendation to not use it would simply be ignored. Instead, a set of practical recommendations is provided in Sections 4.5 and 5.5.3.

对于TLS 1.3（详见《[RFC8446]()》）的推荐做法是默认情况下禁用0-RTT数据，且仅在用户明确理解相关风险的情况下启用。
在DoQ的场景中，允许0-RTT数据能够带来巨大的性能提升，不推荐使用0-RTT数据的要求很有可能会被忽略。
相反，[第4.5章]()和[第5.5.3章]()中提供了一系列可实践的推荐做法。

The specifications in Section 4.5 block the most obvious risks of replay attacks, as they only allow for transactions that will not change the long-term state of the server.

在[第4.5章]()中的规范能够阻挡大多数重放攻击的直接风险，因为它仅允许了不会修改服务器持久数据的事务。

The attacks described above apply to the stub resolver to recursive resolver scenario, but similar attacks might be envisaged in the recursive resolver to authoritative resolver scenario, and the same mitigations apply.

上文描述的攻击适用于存根至递归的场景，但类似地攻击也可以被实行在递归至权威的场景，而该抵御方法仍然适用。
