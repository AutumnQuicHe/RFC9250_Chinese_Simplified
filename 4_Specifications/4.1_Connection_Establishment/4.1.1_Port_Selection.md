By default, a DNS server that supports DoQ MUST listen for and accept QUIC connections on the dedicated UDP port 853 (Section 8), unless there is a mutual agreement to use another port.

默认情况下，支持DoQ的DNS服务器**必须**在专门的UDP端口`853`上监听并接受QUIC连接（详见[第8章]()），除非它与客户端约定了使用另一端口。

By default, a DNS client desiring to use DoQ with a particular server MUST establish a QUIC connection to UDP port 853 on the server, unless there is a mutual agreement to use another port.

默认情况下，希望与某特定服务器使用DoQ的DNS客户端**必须**与服务器的UDP端口`853`建立QUIC连接，除非它与服务器约定了使用另一端口。

DoQ connections MUST NOT use UDP port 53. This recommendation against use of port 53 for DoQ is to avoid confusion between DoQ and the use of DNS over UDP [RFC1035]. The risk of confusion exists even if two parties agreed on port 53, as other parties without knowledge of that agreement might still try to use that port.

DoQ连接**必须不**使用UDP端口`53`。
避免为DoQ使用`53`端口的这项要求是为了防止混淆DoQ与基于UDP的DNS（详见《[RFC1035]()》）。
混淆的后果在于即便双方约定使用`53`端口，也仍然存在不知道这一约定的第三方，它会在该端口试图使用不受支持的协议。

In the stub to recursive scenario, the use of port 443 as a mutually agreed alternative port can be operationally beneficial, since port 443 is used by many services using QUIC and HTTP-3 and is thus less likely to be blocked than other ports. Several mechanisms for stubs to discover recursives offering encrypted transports, including the use of custom ports, are the subject of ongoing work.

在存根至递归场景中，将`443`端口用作双方约定的替代端口的做法也许存在益处，因为比起其他端口，`443`端口被许多QUIC和HTTP/3服务所使用，更不太可能被封锁。
一些可被存根服务器用于发现递归服务器的机制尚处在研究过程中，它们能提供加密的传输方式并支持使用自定义端口。
