By default, a DNS server that supports DoQ MUST listen for and accept QUIC connections on the dedicated UDP port 853 (Section 8), unless there is a mutual agreement to use another port.

By default, a DNS client desiring to use DoQ with a particular server MUST establish a QUIC connection to UDP port 853 on the server, unless there is a mutual agreement to use another port.

DoQ connections MUST NOT use UDP port 53. This recommendation against use of port 53 for DoQ is to avoid confusion between DoQ and the use of DNS over UDP [RFC1035]. The risk of confusion exists even if two parties agreed on port 53, as other parties without knowledge of that agreement might still try to use that port.

In the stub to recursive scenario, the use of port 443 as a mutually agreed alternative port can be operationally beneficial, since port 443 is used by many services using QUIC and HTTP-3 and is thus less likely to be blocked than other ports. Several mechanisms for stubs to discover recursives offering encrypted transports, including the use of custom ports, are the subject of ongoing work.
