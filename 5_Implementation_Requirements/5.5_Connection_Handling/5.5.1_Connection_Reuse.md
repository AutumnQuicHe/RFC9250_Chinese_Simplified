Historic implementations of DNS clients are known to open and close TCP connections for each DNS query. To amortize connection setup costs, both clients and servers SHOULD support connection reuse by sending multiple queries and responses over a single persistent QUIC connection.

In order to achieve performance on par with UDP, DNS clients SHOULD send their queries concurrently over the QUIC streams on a QUIC connection. That is, when a DNS client sends multiple queries to a server over a QUIC connection, it SHOULD NOT wait for an outstanding reply before sending the next query.
