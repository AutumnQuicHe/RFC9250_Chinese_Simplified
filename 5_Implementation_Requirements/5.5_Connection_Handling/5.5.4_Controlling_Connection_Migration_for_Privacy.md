DoQ implementations might consider using the connection migration features defined in Section 9 of [RFC9000]. These features enable connections to continue operating as the client's connectivity changes. As detailed in Section 7.4, these features trade off privacy for latency. By default, clients SHOULD be configured to prioritize privacy and start new sessions if their connectivity changes.

DoQ实现可以考虑使用《[RFC9000]()》的[第9章]()中定义的连接迁移特性。这些特性使得连接能随着客户端连接环境的变化而继续运行。如[第7.4章]()所述，这些特性为了低延迟而牺牲了隐私。默认情况下，**应该**将客户端配置为以隐私为优先，在连接环境变化时启用新会话。
