As specified in Section 7 of [RFC7766] "DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements", resolvers are RECOMMENDED to support the preparing of responses in parallel and sending them out of order. In DoQ, they do that by sending responses on their specific stream as soon as possible, without waiting for availability of responses for previously opened streams.

正如《基于TCP的DNS传输——对实现的要求》（详见《[RFC7766]()》）的[第7章]()所述，**推荐**解析器支持并行地为响应进行准备，且发送响应时无需按照顺序。
在DoQ中，服务器的做法是尽可能快地将响应在各自的流上发送，而不需要按顺序准备响应。
