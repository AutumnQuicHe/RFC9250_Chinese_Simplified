For the stub to recursive scenario, the authentication requirements are the same as described in DoT [RFC7858] and "Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS" [RFC8310]. [RFC8932] states that DNS privacy services SHOULD provide credentials that clients can use to authenticate the server. Given this, and to align with the authentication model for DoH, DoQ stubs SHOULD use a Strict usage profile. Client authentication for the encrypted stub to recursive scenario is not described in any DNS RFC.

For zone transfer, the authentication requirements are the same as described in [RFC9103].

For the recursive to authoritative scenario, authentication requirements are unspecified at the time of writing and are the subject of ongoing work in the DPRIVE WG.
